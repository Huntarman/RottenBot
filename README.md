# RottenBot
A discord bot aimed to make a brain-rotting experience for its users, in light of recent meme culture.
And that was originally what it was going to be, homever I decided to take it in a different direction,
in order to learn many useful IT technologies and tools, such as Docker and DB migrations, but also some asynchronous programming.
I was planning on hosting this app on somewhere, homever I ultimately decided against it.
I'm glad how this project turned out, but I ran out of interesting features to add, might revisit this in the future.
